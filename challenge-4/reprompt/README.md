# Challenge 4 - REPROMPT

Pipelined Data Path
Description: Design a simple 4-stage pipeline for a multiplier.
Evaluation: Correct data flow, pipeline stages, and overall performance.

### Prompting
As an expert in VHDL coding,I need you to design a simple 4-stage pipeline for a multiplier. Use a professional tone and be as detailed as possible in the comments of the code so its explainable. You will be evaluated on correct data flow, pipeline stages, and overall performance. Now you have given me the code below along with the following error, can you generate the code to meet the criteria we have mentioned previously AND fix the bug and errors we are seeing?

## LLAMA 3
Assignment 4 – Pipeline Multiplier: Design failed – syntax error on line 2 [missing “_1164.all” in ieee.std_logic_1164 package declaration], syntax error on lines 37,38 [sign_extend function is not defined].
 

## GROK 2 BETA
Assignment 4 – Pipeline Multiplier: Design failed – logic only performs multiplication of two numbers and does not include partial product calculation/summation for each bit.

## ChatGPT
Assignment 4 – Pipeline Multiplier: Design failed – Error in line 67, compiler cannot determine exact overloaded matching definition for ‘*’. the partial products should be of type unsigned.
 
## GEMINI
Assignment 4 – Pipeline Multiplier: Design failed – The code is incomplete. There are comments in lines 42 and 56 with instructions but the logic has not been implemented by the LLM.
