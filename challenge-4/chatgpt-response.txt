Explanation:
Entity Declaration:

Inputs:
CLK: Clock signal used to synchronize the four pipeline stages.
RESET: Reset signal that initializes the pipeline registers and output.
A, B: 8-bit inputs representing the two operands to be multiplied.
Outputs:
PRODUCT: The 16-bit result of multiplying A and B.
Architecture Body:

Pipeline Registers:
Four pipeline stages are implemented to perform multiplication progressively. Each stage has registers (Stage1_A, Stage2_B, etc.) to store intermediate values.
This approach allows each stage to complete its task in parallel with other stages, improving throughput by processing independent inputs in each clock cycle.
Pipeline Stages:
Stage 1: Latches the inputs A and B. These values are passed to Stage 2.
Stage 2: Performs the actual multiplication (A * B) and produces a partial product. This partial product is passed to Stage 3.
Stage 3: Propagates the partial product to the next stage, readying it for the final step.
Stage 4: Stores the final product and makes it available at the output (PRODUCT).
Clocked Process:
The process triggers on the rising edge of the clock. It also checks for a reset signal, which initializes all pipeline registers to zero.
On each clock cycle, data flows from one stage to the next, ensuring smooth pipelined execution.
Performance Considerations:

Data Flow: The data flows sequentially through four stages, with each stage working in parallel on different inputs, allowing higher throughput and efficient use of clock cycles.
Pipeline Stages: The division into four stages minimizes the critical path (the longest path of logic), increasing clock frequency and improving performance.
Throughput: A new multiplication operation can be initiated every clock cycle, resulting in high throughput once the pipeline is filled.
This design efficiently balances performance and correctness by dividing the multiplication into smaller tasks that can be executed concurrently across pipeline stages.
