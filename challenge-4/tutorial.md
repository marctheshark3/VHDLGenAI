## Description

In this challenge, you are asked to design a simple pipelined data path for a multiplier. The multiplier takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, and produces a single output, `product`. The goal is to implement a multiplier using a pipelined architecture, which allows for higher throughput by processing multiple inputs in parallel.

## Design Requirements

The requirements for this challenge are as follows:

1. **Data Flow**: The data flows from one stage to another, with each stage processing its input and producing an output.

2. **Pipeline Stages**: The code defines four distinct pipeline stages that operate concurrently, reducing the critical path and increasing clock frequency.

3. **Performance**: The design aims for high throughput at the cost of initial latency.

## Design Considerations

When designing the pipelined multiplier, consider the following:

1. **Stage Balancing**: Ensure that each stage takes approximately the same amount of time to execute to avoid pipeline stalls.

2. **Hazard Detection and Resolution**: Implement mechanisms to detect and resolve hazards (e.g., data hazards, control hazards) to maintain correct data flow.

3. **Clock Frequency**: The maximum clock frequency is limited by the critical path through the pipeline.

4. **Code Readability**: Use comments to explain each stage's purpose, which aids in understanding and maintenance of the code.

## Design Example

Here's an example of how you could implement a simple pipelined multiplier in VHDL:

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity PipelinedMultiplier is
    Port (
        clk : in std_logic;
        reset : in std_logic;
        a : in std_logic_vector(15 downto 0);
        b : in std_logic_vector(15 downto 0);
        product : out std_logic_vector(31 downto 0)
    );
end PipelinedMultiplier;

architecture Behavioral of PipelinedMultiplier is

    -- Intermediate signals for pipeline stages
    signal stage1_a, stage1_b : std_logic_vector(15 downto 0);
    signal stage2_partial : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
    signal stage3_sum : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);

begin

    -- Main process for the pipelined multiplier
    process(clk, reset)
    begin
        if reset = '1' then
            -- Reset all pipeline stages
            stage1_a <= (others => '0');
            stage1_b <= (others => '0');
            stage2_partial <= (others => '0');
            stage3_sum <= (others => '0');
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            -- Stage 1: Latch inputs
            stage1_a <= a;
            stage1_b <= b;

            -- Stage 2: Partial product generation
            stage2_partial <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(stage1_a) * unsigned(stage1_b));

            -- Stage 3: Accumulation
            stage3_sum <= stage2_partial;

            -- Stage 4: Output the final product
            product <= stage3_sum;
        end if;
    end process;

end Behavioral;
```

In this example, the multiplier is implemented with four pipeline stages. The first stage latches the inputs `a` and `b`. The second stage generates the partial product by multiplying the latched inputs. The third stage accumulates the partial product. The fourth stage outputs the final product.

Note that this is a simplified example and in a real-world application, you would need to consider issues such as overflow detection and handling, and you might need to use a more sophisticated accumulator or a specialized multiplication unit.

## Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation criteria for this challenge are as follows:

1. **Correct Data Flow**: The data flows correctly from one stage to another, with each stage processing its input and producing an output.
