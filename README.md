## VDHL Needs
1. What is a good asic simulator we can run

## LLM VHDL Coding Questions
1.

## Question Types to LLM(S)
1. Write this code for me
2. Given this code write a tutorial
3. Explain this code

By reframing some of the coding questions to the above questions we can see if one it can solve the problem but how well it is at understanding how to solve and steps to solve it
