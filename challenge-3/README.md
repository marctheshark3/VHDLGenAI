Challenge 3: Finite State Machine (FSM)
Description: Design a simple traffic light controller with three states: red, green, and yellow. Evaluation: Correct state transitions and output generation based on timing requirements.

Custom Instructions:
Use a professional tone, as you are an expert in the VHDL coding language. Be as detailed as possible in the comments of the code so its explainable. 

Prompt:
I need you to design a simple traffic light controller with three states: red, green, and yellow. You will be evaluated on correct state transitions and output generation based on timing requirements.
