Explanation:
Entity Declaration:

Inputs:
CLK: Clock signal used to trigger state transitions.
RESET: Reset signal to initialize the state machine back to the red state.
Outputs:
RED, GREEN, YELLOW: Signals that control the traffic light, corresponding to the red, green, and yellow lights.
Architecture Body:

State Machine:
The controller uses a state machine with three states: Red_State, Green_State, and Yellow_State.
State Transitions: The controller transitions between states based on a timer (Counter). When the counter reaches a defined time limit (e.g., RED_TIME), the state transitions to the next one.
Counter:
The counter serves as a timer, counting clock cycles to determine how long the system remains in each state.
Different time periods are defined for the red, green, and yellow states (RED_TIME, GREEN_TIME, YELLOW_TIME).
Next State Logic:
The NextState_Process handles the logic for determining when the state machine should transition to the next state based on the value of the counter.
Output Logic:
The OutputLogic_Process controls the RED, GREEN, and YELLOW signals based on the current state, ensuring that only one light is on at any given time.
Key Considerations for Performance and Data Flow:
Synchronous Design: The state machine is driven by the rising edge of the clock, ensuring all transitions are synchronized.
Pipeline Stages: The controller transitions through three defined pipeline stages (Red_State, Green_State, Yellow_State), each based on the counter.
Scalability: The design can easily be extended to more complex traffic light systems (e.g., with pedestrian crossings) by adding more states or signals.
This design effectively models the traffic light system with clear state transitions, precise timing, and proper synchronous behavior.
