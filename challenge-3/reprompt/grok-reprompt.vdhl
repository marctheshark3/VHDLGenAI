-- Notes on Design:
-- 1. **State Machine**: Utilizes a Moore machine where outputs depend only on the current state.
-- 2. **Counter Logic**: Corrected to ensure the counter initializes properly for each state transition.
-- 3. **State Transition**: Now strictly occurs when the counter hits zero, fixing the timing compliance issue.
-- 4. **Scalability**: Easy to modify timings or add states by adjusting constants or state logic.
-- 5. **Performance**: The design ensures synchronous operation with predictable state changes, optimizing for clarity and reliability over complexity.
