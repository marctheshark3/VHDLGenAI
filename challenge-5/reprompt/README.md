# Challenge 5

Parameterized Design Entity
Description: Create a generic n-bit shift register with configurable shift direction.
Evaluation: Correct functionality for different bit widths and shift directions.

### Prompting
As an expert in VHDL coding, I need you to create a generic n-bit shift register with configurable shift direction. Use a professional tone and be as detailed as possible in the comments of the code so its explainable. You will be evaluated on correct data flow, pipeline stages, and overall performance. Now you have given me the code below along with the following error, can you generate the code to meet the criteria we have mentioned previously AND fix the bug and errors we are seeing?

## LLAMA 3
Assignment 5 – Shift Register: Design failed – syntax error on line 2 [missing “_1164.all” in ieee.std_logic_1164 package declaration], data_in is serial data and its type should be std_logic. The rest of the logic looks fine. 
 
## GEMINI
Assignment 5 – Shift Register: Design failed – The input data does not get shifted in due to incorrect assignments in lines 26 and 28. Also, data_in should be a serial data of type std_logic.
