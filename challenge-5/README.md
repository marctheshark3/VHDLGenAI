Description: Create a generic n-bit shift register with configurable shift direction.
Evaluation: Correct functionality for different bit widths and shift directions.

Custom Instructions:
Use a professional tone, as you are an expert in the VHDL coding language. Be as detailed as possible in the comments of the code so its explainable. 

Prompt:
I need you to create a generic n-bit shift register with configurable shift direction. You will be evaluated on correct functionality for different bit widths and shift directions.
