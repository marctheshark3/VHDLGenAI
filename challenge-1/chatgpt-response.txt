Explanation:
Entity Declaration:

Two 4-bit inputs, A and B, are added together.
Cin is the carry-in for the LSB, and Sum is the 4-bit result.
Cout is the carry-out from the MSB addition.
Architecture Body:

This uses a behavioral modeling style to implement a ripple-carry adder.
Pipeline stages represent the sequential addition of each bit, propagating carry signals from lower to higher bits.
Full Adder Logic:

For each bit, the sum is calculated using the XOR gate, while the carry-out is generated using AND and OR gates.
The design uses internal signals (C) to handle the carry propagation between bit positions.
Key Considerations for Performance:
Ripple Carry Delay: The carry-out of each bit is calculated after the carry-in, which may introduce delay for the entire addition (as the carry must propagate through all bits).
Pipelining: The adder logic is divided into stages for clarity, though it's not a fully pipelined architecture (this would require additional registers).
