# Challenge 1 - RePROMPT


Simple VHDL Combinational Logic
Description: Design a 4-bit adder using basic logic gates.

## PROMPTING
As an expert in VHDL coding, I need you to design a 4-bit adder using basic logic gates. Use a professional tone and be as detailed as possible in the comments of the code so its explainable. You will be evaluated on correct data flow, pipeline stages, and overall performance. Now you have given me the code below along with the following error, can you generate the code to meet the criteria we have mentioned previously AND fix the bug and errors we are seeing?

## LLAMA 3
Assignment 1 – 4-BitFullAdder: Design failed - syntax error on line 7 [missing “.all” in ieee.std_logic_1164 package declaration], syntax error on line 42 [order of operations not defined, need parenthesis around xnor operation], the output bits are out of order on line 39,  the sequential statements in the process result in the two most significant bits of the output to have unknown values for the first few clock cycles. Carry out should be an output port. 

## GROK 2 BETA
