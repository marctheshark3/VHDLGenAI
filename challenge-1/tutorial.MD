Challenge 1: Simple Combinational Logic

Description: Design a 4-bit adder using basic logic gates.

Evaluation: Correctness of the adder's output for all possible input combinations.

In this challenge, you are asked to design a 4-bit adder using basic logic gates. The adder takes two 4-bit inputs, `A` and `B`, and produces a 4-bit output, `S`, which represents the sum of the two inputs. The adder also produces a carry-out signal, `Cout`, which is the carry-out of the most significant bit (MSB) addition.

To solve this challenge, you will need to use basic logic gates such as AND, OR, and XOR. The adder logic can be implemented using a combination of these gates.

Here is a high-level approach to designing a 4-bit adder:

1. Create a process that takes `A`, `B`, and `Cin` as inputs.
2. Calculate the sum for each bit position using XOR gates.
3. Calculate the carry-out for each bit position using AND and OR gates.
4. Assign the sum and carry-out values to the appropriate output signals.

Here is a sample VHDL code snippet that implements a 4-bit adder:

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity four_bit_adder is
    Port (
        A : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (3 downto 0);
        B : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (3 downto 0);
        Cin : in STD_LOGIC;
        S : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (3 downto 0);
        Cout : out STD_LOGIC
    );
end four_bit_adder;

architecture Behavioral of four_bit_adder is
begin
    process (A, B, Cin)
    begin
        -- Calculate the sum for each bit position
        S(0) <= A(0) xor B(0) xor Cin;
        S(1) <= A(1) xor B(1) xor Cin;
        S(2) <= A(2) xor B(2) xor S(1);
        S(3) <= A(3) xor B(3) xor S(2);

        -- Calculate the carry-out for each bit position
        Cout <= (A(3) and B(3)) or (A(3) and Cin) or (B(3) and Cin);
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

In this code, the adder logic is implemented in a process that takes `A`, `B`, and `Cin` as inputs. The sum for each bit position is calculated using XOR gates, and the carry-out for each bit position is calculated using AND and OR gates. The sum and carry-out values are assigned to the appropriate output signals.

I hope this helps you get started with the challenge. Let me know if you have any further questions!
