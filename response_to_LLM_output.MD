# REPONSE TO LLM OUTPUT
## LLAMA 3
Assignment 1 – 4-BitFullAdder: Design failed - syntax error on line 7 [missing “.all” in ieee.std_logic_1164 package declaration], syntax error on line 42 [order of operations not defined, need parenthesis around xnor operation], the output bits are out of order on line 39,  the sequential statements in the process result in the two most significant bits of the output to have unknown values for the first few clock cycles. Carry out should be an output port. 
 
Assignment 2 – D-Flip Flop w enable: Design failed - syntax error on line 5 [missing “.all” in ieee.std_logic_1164 package declaration]. The logic looks fine.
 
Assignment 3 – Traffic light SM: Design failed – syntax error on line 2 [missing “_1164.all” in ieee.std_logic_1164 package declaration], syntax error on lines 31, 37, 43 [cannot convert user-defined signal type to unsigned. VHDL does not have built in support to perform the conversion. LLM needs to define the conversion function], the entity should include traffic lights as output ports.
 
Assignment 4 – Pipeline Multiplier: Design failed – syntax error on line 2 [missing “_1164.all” in ieee.std_logic_1164 package declaration], syntax error on lines 37,38 [sign_extend function is not defined].
 
Assignment 5 – Shift Register: Design failed – syntax error on line 2 [missing “_1164.all” in ieee.std_logic_1164 package declaration], data_in is serial data and its type should be std_logic. The rest of the logic looks fine. 


## GROK 2 BETA
Assignment 1 – 4-BitFullAdder: Design failed - the entity for the full adder is not defined.
 
Assignment 2 – D-Flip Flop w enable: Design passed.
 
Assignment 3 – Traffic light: Design failed - fails to comply with state transition times defined in the architecture.
 
Assignment 4 – Pipeline Multiplier: Design failed – logic only performs multiplication of two numbers and does not include partial product calculation/summation for each bit.
 
Assignment 5 – Shift Register: Design passed.

## CHAGPT
Assignment 1 – 4-BitFullAdder: Design passed.
 
Assignment 2 – D-Flip Flop: Design failed – Error in line 36, cannot read from output q, need to use a buffer. The Qn assignment needs to be a concurrent statement outside of the process.
 
Assignment 3 – Traffic light: Design failed – Simulation error due to counter being driven in multiple processes. Only the “TrafficLight_Process” should reset/increment the counter.
 
Assignment 4 – Pipeline Multiplier: Design failed – Error in line 67, compiler cannot determine exact overloaded matching definition for ‘*’. the partial products should be of type unsigned.
 
Assignment 5 – Shift Register: Design passed. 

## GEMINI
Assignment 1 – 4-BitFullAdder: Design failed - The full adder entity and architecture are not defined.
 
Assignment 2 – D-Flip Flop: Design failed – Error in line 33. Cannot read from output q, need to use a buffer.
 
Assignment 3 – Traffic light: Design failed – Light changes from red to yellow and green to red. Also, the traffic light changes color every clock cycle.  
 
Assignment 4 – Pipeline Multiplier: Design failed – The code is incomplete. There are comments in lines 42 and 56 with instructions but the logic has not been implemented by the LLM.
 
Assignment 5 – Shift Register: Design failed – The input data does not get shifted in due to incorrect assignments in lines 26 and 28. Also, data_in should be a serial data of type std_logic.

## CLAUDE 
Claude assignment 2 - DFF w enable: functioning as expected. 
Claude assignment 3 - traffic light ctrl: the design looks good and functioning as expected. 
Claude assignment 4 - pipelined multiplier: the code is not complete, does not show partial products computation or summation. I can look for tutorials for pipelining in VDHL to train the model and try again.
Claude assignment 5 - shift register: the design looks good and functioning as expected.
