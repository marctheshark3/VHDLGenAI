-- Description: A synchronous D flip-flop with an enable input

library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity DFlipFlopEnable is
    Port (
        clk    : in std_logic;  -- Clock signal
        reset  : in std_logic;  -- Asynchronous reset signal
        enable : in std_logic;  -- Enable signal for the flip-flop
        D      : in std_logic;  -- Data input
        Q      : out std_logic  -- Data output
    );
end DFlipFlopEnable;

architecture Behavioral of DFlipFlopEnable is
    -- Internal signal to hold the state of the flip-flop
    signal state : std_logic := '0';
begin

    -- Process for synchronous behavior with asynchronous reset
    process(clk, reset)
    begin
        if reset = '1' then
            -- Asynchronous reset to initialize the flip-flop to 0
            state <= '0';
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            if enable = '1' then
                -- If enable is high, update the state with the input D
                state <= D;
            end if;
            -- If enable is low, the state remains unchanged
        end if;
    end process;

    -- Output the current state
    Q <= state;

end Behavioral;

-- Notes on Design:
-- 1. **Synchronous Operation**: The flip-flop only changes state on the rising edge of the clock,
--    which ensures predictable timing behavior.

-- 2. **Enable Feature**: The 'enable' input allows the flip-flop to either capture new data or 
--    hold its current state, which is useful in designs where data should only be updated under 
--    certain conditions.

-- 3. **Asynchronous Reset**: The 'reset' is asynchronous, meaning it can reset the flip-flop 
--    regardless of the clock state. This is crucial for initializing the system or for emergency 
--    resets.

-- 4. **Data Flow**: 
--   - Data (D) flows into the flip-flop when 'enable' is high and there's a clock edge.
--   - The output (Q) reflects the last state captured from D when enabled, or holds its value 
--     when disabled.

-- 5. **Pipeline Stages**: 
--   - While not a pipeline in the traditional multi-stage sense, the flip-flop itself can be 
--     considered a single stage in a larger pipeline, storing data for one clock cycle.

-- 6. **Performance**: 
--   - **Setup Time**: D and enable must be stable before the clock's rising edge by the setup time 
--     of the flip-flop for correct operation.
--   - **Hold Time**: After the clock edge, D and enable must remain stable for the hold time to 
--     ensure the data is correctly latched.
--   - **Clock-to-Q Delay**: The time it takes for Q to reflect the change in D after the clock 
--     edge, which impacts how quickly this flip-flop can be used in subsequent logic.

-- 7. **Usage**: This component is fundamental in digital design, used in registers, counters, 
--    state machines, and any logic requiring memory of previous states with control over when 
--    to update that memory.
