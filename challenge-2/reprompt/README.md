# Challenge 2

Sequential Logic with Clock
Description: Design a synchronous D flip-flop with enable input.
Evaluation: Correct data storage and output behavior based on clock and enable signals.

## PROMPTING
As an expert in VHDL coding, I need you to design a synchronous D flip-flop with enable input. Use a professional tone and be as detailed as possible in the comments of the code so its explainable. You will be evaluated on correct data flow, pipeline stages, and overall performance. Now you have given me the code below along with the following error, can you generate the code to meet the criteria we have mentioned previously AND fix the bug and errors we are seeing?

## LLAMA 3 
Assignment 2 – D-Flip Flop w enable: Design failed - syntax error on line 5 [missing “.all” in ieee.std_logic_1164 package declaration]. The logic looks fine.

## CHAGPT
Assignment 2 – D-Flip Flop: Design failed – Error in line 36, cannot read from output q, need to use a buffer. The Qn assignment needs to be a concurrent statement outside of the process.

## GEMINI
Assignment 2 – D-Flip Flop: Design failed – Error in line 33. Cannot read from output q, need to use a buffer.
