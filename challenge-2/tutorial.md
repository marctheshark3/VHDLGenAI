### Description

Design a synchronous D flip-flop with enable input.

### Evaluation

Correct data storage and output behavior based on clock and enable signals.

## Tutorial

In this challenge, you are asked to design a synchronous D flip-flop with an enable input. The D flip-flop is a fundamental building block of digital circuits. It is a sequential logic element that stores the input data and produces the output data.

A D flip-flop with an enable input allows for selective updates of the stored data. The enable input determines whether the flip-flop should update its state or hold its current state.

Here are the key components of a D flip-flop with an enable input:

1. **Data Input (D):** The input signal that represents the data to be stored in the flip-flop.

2. **Clock Input (CLK):** The clock signal that controls the timing of the flip-flop's updates.

3. **Enable Input (EN):** The input signal that determines whether the flip-flop should update its state.

4. **Outputs (Q, Q_not):** The output signals that represent the stored data and its complement.

To design a D flip-flop with an enable input, you need to define the entity and architecture of the flip-flop.

Here is an example of how to define the entity and architecture of a D flip-flop with an enable input in VHDL:

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity DFlipFlopWithEnable is
    Port (
        D   : in  STD_LOGIC;
        CLK : in  STD_LOGIC;
        EN  : in  STD_LOGIC;
        Q   : out STD_LOGIC;
        Q_not : out STD_LOGIC
    );
end DFlipFlopWithEnable;

architecture Behavioral of DFlipFlopWithEnable is
    signal Reg_D, Next_State : std_logic;
begin
    -- Flip-flop logic
    process(CLK)
    begin
        if rising_edge(CLK) then
            if EN = '1' then
                Reg_D <= D;
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;

    -- Output assignments
    Q <= Reg_D;
    Q_not <= not Reg_D;
end Behavioral;
```

In this example, the entity `DFlipFlopWithEnable` defines the ports of the flip-flop. The architecture `Behavioral` defines the internal logic of the flip-flop.

The flip-flop logic is implemented in a process that is sensitive to the clock signal. Inside the process, we check if the enable input is high. If it is, we update the register with the new value of the data input.

The output values are assigned based on the current state of the register.

To evaluate the correctness of the D flip-flop with an enable input, you need to consider the following:

1. **Data Flow:** The data flows correctly from the input (D) to the output (Q and Q_not) based on the enable input.

2. **Enable Input:** The enable input determines whether the flip-flop should update its state or hold its current state.

3. **Clock Synchronization:** The flip-flop is synchronized with the clock signal.

4. **Timing:** The timing of the flip-flop is correctly implemented to ensure predictable behavior.

I hope this tutorial helps you understand how to design a D flip-flop with an enable input. Let me know if you have any further questions!
