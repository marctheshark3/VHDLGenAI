Explanation:
Entity Declaration:

Inputs:
D: Data input to be stored in the flip-flop.
CLK: Clock signal to synchronize the flip-flop's operations.
EN: Enable input that allows the flip-flop to capture data only when high.
Outputs:
Q: The stored data value.
Qn: The inverted version of Q.
Architecture Body:

Synchronous Behavior:
The process is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock (rising_edge(CLK)), ensuring that data is only updated in sync with the clock.
Enable Control:
When EN is high (EN = '1'), the flip-flop captures the data from D and stores it in Q.
If EN is low, the flip-flop holds the previous value, ensuring stable operation when no new data is needed.
Inverted Output:
Qn is continuously updated as the complement of Q without requiring a clock edge.
Key Performance and Data Flow Considerations:
Synchronous Operation: Data (D) is captured only on the rising edge of the clock, ensuring robust synchronization in digital systems.
Enable Input: The enable (EN) ensures the flip-flop only updates when required, saving power and preventing unnecessary state changes.
Pipelining: While this basic flip-flop design operates in a single stage, it can be incorporated into more complex designs for pipelining by cascading multiple flip-flops for sequential stages.
