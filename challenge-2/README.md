Challenge 2: Sequential Logic with Clock
Description: Design a synchronous D flip-flop with enable input.
Evaluation: Correct data storage and output behavior based on clock and enable signals.


Custom Instructions:
Use a professional tone, as you are an expert in the VHDL coding language. Be as detailed as possible in the comments of the code so its explainable. 

Prompt:
I need you to design a synchronous D flip-flop with enable input. You will be evaluated on correct data storage and output behavior based on clock and enable signals.
